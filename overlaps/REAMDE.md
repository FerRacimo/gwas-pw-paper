Pairwise overlaps of GWAS hits. 

Files are of the form [pheno1]_[pheno2].overlap_wbetas. 

Each file contains all of the top SNPs identified in pheno1 and their Z-scores for pheno2 (if the SNP is present). Z_1 and V_1 are the Z-score and variance for the SNP association with pheno1, and Z/V are the corresponding summary stats for pheno2.
