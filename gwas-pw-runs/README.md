This directory contains a subset of the output from running gwas-pw on all pairs of GWAS. 

Each pair is listed in the file all_pairs. A subset of the output is available in output/

The output contains regional Bayes factors and summary statistics for each pair (in the .segbfs.gz files), and the maximim a posteriori estimates of the parameters (in the *.MLE files). Note that many segbf.gz files are not present because they were run on data that is not publicly available (the platelet count/volume studies and the 23andMe studies).
